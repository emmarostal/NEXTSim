PIsoFull is "pseudo isotropic" with test.mac and full isolde setup. The actual direction for
the 10e4 1MeV neutrons was directly upwards. Almost 20% of these neutrons were detected, meaning
that all detected neutrons were scattered at least once, leading to the higher TOF values.

IsoFull is true isotropic, but otherwise the same as PIsoFull.Same tendency with mainly scattered
low energy neutrons. However, the truly isotropic source means that only 7% of the 10e4 neutrons were
detected.

IsoFullLong is same as IsoFull, but with 10e5 neutrons. Same behaviour as IsoFull is observed.

It seems like iso=0 and iso=1do not work as intended.
