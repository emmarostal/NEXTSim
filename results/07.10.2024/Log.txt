Doing runs with gaussian energydistribution and plotting initial energy vs calculated kinetic energy for the neutrons. 
Removing negative TOF and also removing un-physically high energies. What causes these very high energies (low TOF)?

Maybe look only at multiplicity ==1?

It is not due to geometric correction, since we correct to slightly higher energies (or not at all)
