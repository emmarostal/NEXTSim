Doing runs with gaussian energydistribution and plotting initial energy vs calculated kinetic energy for the neutrons. 
Removing negative TOF and also removing un-physically high energies. What causes these very high energies (low TOF)?

Maybe look only at multiplicity ==1?

It is not due to geometric correction, since we correct to slightly higher energies (or not at all)

In general, we see more values of lower calculated energies for the full setup compared to just the detector arrac. This
is most likely due to scattering in the surrounding materials. In the same way, we see more low valuesof calculated energies for
higher multiplicities when looking at just the detector arrays compared to lower multiplicities. Again, this could be attributed
to scattering from one detector into another.



tree->Draw("detID:eventID", "multiplicity==2 && abs(detID[0] - detID[1]) == 1"); To look at events where two adjacent detectors are hit.
