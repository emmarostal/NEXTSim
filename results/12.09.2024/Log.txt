Implement geometrical correction (13.5 cm/ns)
Consider what this means for scattered neutrons, which take a different path...
Look at Jeppe's code
look at 49K data (compare to simulation)
Change pseudoiso (make new?) to include entire array
Make the simulation work for a single detector

implement realistic two-neutron source

------------------------------------------------------

Since a large part (about 1/3) of the total amount of observed neutrons are definitely scattered, but likely more (with full setup rather 
than just detectors - see 10.09.2024), the brute force method of implementing a geometrical correction could lead to overcorrections 
when done on a setup more complicated than a single detector and a source. Scattering takes place in the isolde-setup itself but also 
from one detector in the array to another. Maybe a different strategy should be utilized? But this is the method used to treat the actual 
experimental data, so perhaps the correction is not too large? It is at least worth considering.
Possible explanation: The problem arises from scattered neutrons, meaning that the detected energies are lower than the ones
defining the peaks - if we know which energies to expect, this is not a problem, as energies other than the peak can be ignored.
For neutrons scattered from one detector into another, these events can possibly be filtered out as false two-neutron events.

However, the geometrical correction still poses a potential problem if many different neutron energies are expected
especially if both higher and lower neutron energies are interesting for an experiment, since scattered high energy neutrons
can distort the readout for lower energy neutrons.

Used data Full_2MeV from 11.09.2024 and looked for events where a neutron was scattered from one detector into another (or more)

about 2.64%% of the detected events had mult=3 251/9506 
about 18.47% of the detected events had mult=2 1756/9506 
about 78.42% of the detected events had mult=1 7455/9506 

Used data Full_500keV from 11.09.2024 and looked for events where a neutron was scattered from one detector into another (or more)

about 1.16% of the detected events had mult=3 158/13675  
about 16.97% of the detected events had mult=2 2320/13675 
about 81.85% of the detected events had mult=1 11193/13675

Used data Full_300keV from 11.09.2024 and looked for events where a neutron was scattered from one detector into another (or more)

about 0.65%% of the detected events had mult=3 91/14044
about 15.81%% of the detected events had mult=2 2220/14044
about 83.54% of the detected events had mult=1 11733/14044

A general tendency seems to be more events with higher multiplicity for higher energies, which makes sense:D

Saw some entries with negative TOF (thus, the filter) Why? Not related to multiplicity, perhaps it is fine to simply filter out?
