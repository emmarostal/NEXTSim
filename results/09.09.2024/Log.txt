Testing mylar wrapping instead of esr - which one is correct?
Main result seems to be way faster simulations...

mylar:
10e4 (001) 30s simulation time
10e5 (002) 350s simulation time

esr:
See IsoFull and IsoFullLong from 06.09.2024 (short simulation time 600s)

Testing simulations without large frame, since most warnings are about "frameRibs"
(003) No warnings about geometries - we still see the heavily reduced energies and 7% detection.

(004) Without isolde setup - Same behaviour as with full setup. Detection lower, about 4%. WHY??

(005) Just one detector, no isolde, 10 mil neutrons - Every entry is TOF = 0. Odd.

(006) Resized detectors in array and set pmt values to correspond with vandle.mac 
- generally higher energies (max TOF is now 400ns rather than 600ns).
