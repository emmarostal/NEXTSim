Goal for today: Make simulation TOF work with a single detector (multioutput vs single)
Also: Understand why the energies are so low with only detectors and a source.
Also: Understand physics of "two-neutron"-event.
Also: Figure out correct pmt values and wrapping material
Also: repair frame stl file?
Maybe: Look ar real data



Removed random offset for bar variables in nDetRunAction.cc. Resulting TOF spectrum
looks more homogenous, but the values are still shifted too high.

Changed energy threshold in nDetRunAction.cc. No major difference.

analyzePolyCFD has been changed. Trying the old version. No difference.

The problem was the forced segmentation of the pmts!!!!!!!
I forced it to not be segmented.
(011) Full isolde setup
(012) Just detector array

Removed unnessecary changes and print statements again

(001) Long run with full setup
(002) Long run with only detector array


TODO
Try different energies
Fix pseudoiso
implement geometric correction (which speed?) 13.5 cm/ns
See if it works with just one detector
implement new source
