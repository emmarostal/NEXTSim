Code stil does not work correctly with a single detector after implementing
/nDet/detector/setPmtColumns 1
/nDet/detector/setPmtRows 1
and thus forcing the pmt to not be segmented.(Technically to be 1 segment).

Tested with an array of one and two detectors. The problem persisted for one detector, but was not present 
as soon as there were more than one detector present.


Made 10e5 neutron runs with the full setup and at different energies (not geometrically corrected) iso = 2
(001) 2MeV
(002) 500keV
(003) 300keV

Implemented 49K as a viable neutron source.

Looked at the direction of the beam.
with iso = 0 and /nDet/source/direction 90 270 0,
the beam points directly at the center of the middle array-detector. It takes angles (in deg) rather than distances.

Changing the iso value to 1 overwrites this. It seems like iso = 0 can be set correctly now, iso = 2 works as expected
and iso = 1 shoots pseudoisotropically only in the vicinity of one detector in the array (first or last).


TODO
Implement geometrical correction (13.5 cm/ns)
Look at Jeppes code
look at 49K data (compare to simulation)
Change pseudoiso (make new?) to include entire array
Make the simulation work for a single detector
Include frame
